## About Deskthority wiki

The Deskthority wiki was dedicated to mechanical keyboards, mice, and other human interface devices. Its main focus was on everything regarding quality (mechanical) keyboards. In the nature of a wiki, the content was frequently and constantly under construction. It invited users to share their knowledge and help create what aimed to be the best input device wiki.
The wiki was part of the Deskthority forum â€“ users could sign in with their forum account and start editing. There was no separate registration, and it functioned as an open wiki. For discussions about the wiki, requests for higher wiki rights, or changes/add-ons to the wiki engine, users were directed to the wiki subforum.

At its height (or, At the time of its archival / Before active updates ceased), it had accumulated approximately 1,929 articles, 17,571 pages, and 46,940 edits.

## About This Archive

The Deskthority wiki was an invaluable resource for keyboard enthusiasts, containing a wealth of community-driven information. In late 2024 (around October), Deskthority.net was sold to Brown Brothers Media. Following this acquisition, the community observed several changes:

*   The wiki became inaccessible for logged-in users, preventing edits and new contributions.
*   New user registrations for the site were halted.
*   The content strategy for the main Deskthority blog appeared to shift towards AI-generated articles, differing from its previous community-focused content.

Given these developments, the existing community-generated wiki contents were completely gone. This repository was created to preserve the Topre and Electrostatic Capacitive (EC) specific sections. The pages have been archived as HTML files to maintain their original content and formatting as closely as possible, as they existed prior to or during these transitions.

**Please Note:**
*   This is a *snapshot* in time. The content reflects the state of the pages around the time they were last saved in the Wayback Machine.
*   Links to other sections of the Deskthority wiki (not included here) or external websites will likely be broken or lead to offline pages.
*   The styling and functionality might not be perfect, as it relies on the saved HTML and potentially missing assets from the original site.
